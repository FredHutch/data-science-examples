# Contributing a code example

In addition to the documentation provided in this wiki, we maintain a repository of coding examples to demonstrate the use of our coding standards, while showcasing some features and packages that could be useful in your research. We aim to include projects of various scope, so we can exhibit the software development principals in different types of user interfaces (e.g.: packages and interactive notebooks will both be included with appropriate documentation).

We encourage a broad range of coding example submissions from researchers, with the hope that it will enhance innovation and learning within Fred Hutch. The submission requirements are outlined in the following section, [Fred Hutch Software Development Standards](#fred-hutch-software-development-standards). In addition to creating reference material for your peers and gaining local notoriety as an awesome developer/researcher, you will have the added benefit of additional technical review and sharing/communicating your work with other researchers that may be interested in follow up.

### Submitting Your Code
When you have completed a coding project that you would like to submit to the examples wiki, there are a few steps in Github to navigate the review process. In order to submit to the repo, you will need to join the Fred Hutch GitHub organization by sending your GitHub username to `helpdesk` with a request to be added. For additional resources on using GitHub at Fred Hutch, see our [Wiki page on the topic](/scicomputing/software_managecode/).

A common use of the examples repository will be to clone a copy locally and play with the available code. For this reason, we ask that data files not be stored in the repository.
