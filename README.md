# Fred Hutch Data Science Wiki Code Examples

A repository of tested, documented example code for use with Fred Hutch computing resources.  

If you have trouble viewing a notebook (files that end in `*.ipynb`), you can copy the URL to the GitHub page on which it is failing to render and use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) to see the contents of the notebook.

## Accessing the Examples

Examples can be explored in a web browser by clicking the link above. Alternatively, you can use github to clone a copy to your local machine, where you can modify and play with the example code independently.

```
git clone https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki-code-examples.git
```

For more information on using Github, see the [Managing and Sharing Code](/scicomputing/software_managecode/) page in this wiki.
